Traditional development practices are no longer enough to keep up the pace required in today's business landscape. Developers are challenged to write software faster while continuously improving the quality of what they deliver. This workshop will explore how to use GitHub to rapidly and reliably create secure software. You'll learn to develop and secure an application using GitHub Codespaces, GitHub Copilot, GitHub Actions, and GitHub Advanced Security.

- **Who is this for**: Enterprise and Open Source Developers
- **What you'll learn**: How to use the suite of GitHub offerings to improve the development process
- **What you'll build**: An application which is integrated with all of these components

## Learning Objectives

In this workshop, you will:

- Learn how to use GitHub Codespaces to create consistent, ready-to-run development environments
- Use GitHub Actions with GitHub Advanced Security to automate your pipeline and identify security vulnerabilities
- Reduce bugs and improve code quality with GitHub Copilot

## :mega: Prerequisites
